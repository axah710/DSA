//? Unified Problem-Solving Process:-

//? 1. Understand the Problem
//! - Clearly identify and define the problem.
//! - Specify the input and expected output.
//! - Ensure you understand all requirements and constraints.

//? 2. Generate Solution Examples
//! - Think of possible examples or scenarios for the problem.
//! - Identify patterns or relationships between inputs and outputs.

//? 3. Break Down the Problem
//! - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable pieces.
//! - Simplify each piece to its core functionality.
//! - If necessary, continue breaking it down further.

//? 4. Draft a Step-by-Step Plan
//! - Write out the problem-solving steps.
//! - Check that each step contributes to solving the problem as a whole.

//? 5. Test with Sample Inputs
//! - Use test cases or examples to manually verify the steps.
//! - Observe how inputs are transformed into outputs.

//? 6. Implement the Solution
//! - Begin coding or constructing the solution based on the steps.
//! - Focus on solving one small piece at a time before integrating them.

//? 7. Verify and Optimize
//! - Test the solution with a wide range of inputs, including edge cases.
//! - Ensure all possible rules and conditions are handled correctly.
//! - Evaluate the solutionâ€™s efficiency (e.g., time complexity, space complexity) and optimize where possible.

//? 8. Final Review
//! - Check if anything was overlooked or misunderstood in the problem.
//! - Ensure the solution meets all requirements and outputs are accurate.
